# Nginx as Reverse Proxy and Load Balancer

It is visualization for a load balancer made using Nginx.

## Working of Load Balancing
![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1024/1*TrNJZqECEj0eVuJDeNKtNQ.png)
1. Clients sends requests to Nginx server which acts as a reverse proxy for our main application servers.
2. Depending on different configuration, the load balancer passes the request to most deserving server.
3. The server responds with the response to the load balancer and then load balancer passes it to client. 

# Project Description

## Application Servers
Here, we have 2 application servers 
1. server1-port-8001
2. server2-port-8002

For the purpose of project, these 2 servers are running on different ports but they could be entirely different machines.

## Redis Caching

- The servers are fetching data from an Image API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos
- The data is cached in the redis and whenever the same query is requested, the cached data is send instead of fetching it again.

## Nginx Server
- The Nginx Server is running on port 8080
- In the nginx configuration file, we set the upstream to server url of these 2 servers.
- Then, all the requests which are coming to port 8080 are transferred to either server1 or server2.

## Load Balancing Logic
- Here, we are using a weighted load balancing algorithm.
- The power of server1 to server2 is 1 : 2 i.e. server2 can handle twice the number of requests than server1
- The process runs in a round robin fashion.

## Demo of the App

Here, is a simple visualization of 6 requests.

| Request Number | Requested PORT | Redirected PORT |
|--------|---------|----------|
|   1    | Port 8080 | Port 8001 : Server 1|
|   2    | Port 8080 | Port 8002 : Server 2|
|   3    | Port 8080 | Port 8002 : Server 2|
|   4    | Port 8080 | Port 8001 : Server 1|
|   5    | Port 8080 | Port 8002 : Server 2|
|   6    | Port 8080 | Port 8002 : Server 2|


## Run the application
```bash
<!-- Clone the Repository -->
git clone https://github.com/hritik-agarwal/loadBalancer.git

<!-- Install the Dependencies -->
npm install

<!-- Star server 1 in terminal 1 -->
PORT=8001 node server.js

<!-- Star server 2 in terminal 2 -->
PORT=8002 node server.js

<!-- Start the nginx with given configuration -->
nginx
```
* Open browser and visit http://localhost:8080
* Refresh the window, to see which server the response is coming from
